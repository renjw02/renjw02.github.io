I am a Master’s student in Computer Science at the University of California, San Diego. Prior to this, I earned my B.Eng. in Software Engineering from Tsinghua University.

I am fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Zhiting Hu](https://zhiting.ucsd.edu/) and [Prof. Lianhui Qin](https://lianhui.ucsd.edu/) at UCSD. Currently, I am leading the development of [SimWorld](https://simworld-cvpr2025.maitrix.org/), an embodied city-scale simulator. This project serves as a full-stack AI platform that integrates large language models with a photorealistic physical environment to benchmark agents across a wide spectrum of capabilities—from high-level decision making to low-level control.

Previously, I worked with [Prof. Chaokun Wang](https://wangchaokun.github.io/index.html) at Tsinghua University on polystore systems and natural language to structured query translation (NL2SQL), where I gained hands-on experience in fine-tuning pre-trained models. I also interned at [JD.com](https://corporate.jd.com/) as a Data Engineer, where I worked on large-scale data systems and backend engineering.

My research interests include **natural language processing**, **embodied AI**, **large language models (LLMs)**, and **multimodal LLMs (MLLMs)**.

You can find my cv [here](../assets/cv.pdf).
