I am a Master’s student in Computer Science at the University of California, San Diego. Prior to this, I earned my B.Eng. in Software Engineering from Tsinghua University.

I am fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Zhiting Hu](https://zhiting.ucsd.edu/) and [Prof. Lianhui Qin](https://lianhui.ucsd.edu/) at UCSD. Currently, I am leading the development of [SimWorld](https://simworld-cvpr2025.maitrix.org/), an embodied city-scale simulator. This project serves as a full-stack AI platform that integrates large language models with a photorealistic physical environment to benchmark agents across a wide spectrum of capabilities—from high-level decision making to low-level control.

Previously, I worked with [Prof. Chaokun Wang](https://wangchaokun.github.io/index.html) at Tsinghua University on polystore systems and natural language to structured query translation (NL2SQL), where I gained hands-on experience in fine-tuning pre-trained models. I also interned at [JD.com](https://corporate.jd.com/) as a Data Engineer, where I worked on large-scale data systems and backend engineering.

My research interests span **Machine Learning**, **Natural Language Processing**, and **Embodied AI**. I am particularly interested in evaluating language models, identifying their potential limitations, and developing methods to address them. I am also fascinated by the ways in which language connects us to the physical world. My goal is to create embodied agents capable of communicating and collaborating with humans in a seamless and intuitive manner—moving beyond static datasets to interact with and learn from the complexity of the real world. Ultimately, I hope these agents can function as general intelligences, capable of solving problems and operating effectively in complex, real-world environments.
