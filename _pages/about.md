I am a Master’s student in Computer Science at the University of California, San Diego. Prior to this, I earned my B.Eng. in Software Engineering from Tsinghua University.

I am fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Lianhui Qin](https://lianhui.ucsd.edu/) and [Prof. Zhiting Hu](https://zhiting.ucsd.edu/) at UCSD. I lead the [SimWorld](https://simworld.org/) project, an open-ended realistic simulator for autonomous agents in physical and social environments, which has been publicly released and is continuously maintained and updated. Leveraging SimWorld, we have developed a multi-agent delivery benchmark to evaluate both collaboration and competition among LLM-powered agents. My current focus is on enabling real-time reasoning for embodied agents, with the goal of assessing their performance in dynamic, real-world scenarios.

Previously, I worked with [Prof. Chaokun Wang](https://wangchaokun.github.io/index.html) at Tsinghua University on multi-model database systems and natural language to structured query translation (NL2SQL), where I focused on semantic representation and fine-tuning pre-trained models. Additionally, I interned as a Data Engineer at [JD.com](https://corporate.jd.com/), gaining hands-on experience in data mining, exploratory data analysis, and machine learning.

My research interests lie at the intersection of **machine learning**, **embodied AI**, and **multi-modal reasoning**. I am particularly interested in understanding how semantic information from different modalities—such as language and vision—can be represented and integrated to enable agents to perceive, reason, and act effectively. Currently, I focus on designing and evaluating embodied agents in simulated or controlled environments, exploring how they can learn from interactions and generalize beyond static datasets. In the long term, I aim to advance agentic AI, developing intelligent agents capable of collaborating with humans and solving complex tasks in real-world settings.
