I am a Master’s student in Computer Science at the University of California, San Diego. Prior to this, I earned my B.Eng. in Software Engineering from Tsinghua University.

My research interests lie at the intersection of **multi-modal reasoning** and **AI agents**. I'm particularly interested in how we can close the perception-action loop: transforming large models from passive processors of static data into interactive agents that can actively perceive, reason, and adapt within complex, real-world scenarios. Currently, I focus on long-horizon reasoning, exploring how agents can maintain consistency and improve through interaction. In the long term, I aim to advance agentic AI, developing intelligent agents capable of collaborating with humans and solving complex tasks in real-world settings.

I am fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Lianhui Qin](https://lianhui.ucsd.edu/) and [Prof. Zhiting Hu](https://zhiting.ucsd.edu/) at UCSD. I co-led the [SimWorld](https://simworld.org/) project, an open-ended realistic simulator for autonomous agents in physical and social environments. Previously, I worked with [Prof. Chaokun Wang](https://wangchaokun.github.io/index.html) at Tsinghua University on multi-model database systems and natural language to structured query translation (NL2SQL). Additionally, I interned as a Data Engineer at [JD.com](https://corporate.jd.com/), gaining hands-on experience in data mining, exploratory data analysis, and machine learning.
