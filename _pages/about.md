I am a Master's student in Computer Science at the University of California, San Diego. Before that, I received my bachelor degree in Tsinghua University (B.Eng in Software Engineering).

I am fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Zhiting Hu](https://zhiting.ucsd.edu/) and [Prof. Lianhui Qin](https://lianhui.ucsd.edu/), UCSD. Currently I'm leading a team in developing an embodied simulator [SimWorld](https://simworld-cvpr2025.maitrix.org/). This project is a full-stack AI application that integrates the power of a large language model with a physical simulator, to enable the various levels of agents benchmarking from high-vision decision making to low-level action control.

Previously I was advised by [Prof. Chaokun Wang](https://wangchaokun.github.io/index.html), Tsinghua University, where I worked on polystore system and NL2SQL, where I gained experience on fine-tuning pre-trained models. Before that, I interned in [JD.com](https://corporate.jd.com/) as a Data Engineer, where I gained experience on software engineering and data engineering.

My research interests lie natural language processing, embodied ai, llms and mllms.
